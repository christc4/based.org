## Relation to acmeee

From [golem.de](https://www.golem.de/news/oberon-eth-das-schweizer-system-2301-170754-2.html)

> Oberon also relies heavily on the middle mouse button of a three-button mouse: it is used to execute commands and file operations. To do this, for example, click on "System.ShowModules" in the system tool and another window opens that shows the currently loaded modules with memory information.

> The left mouse button gives us a cursor for editing or typing or for changing window sizes. The right mouse button is used for highlighting. There is no tricky double-click. You quickly get used to this type of user interface - it helps that it is consistently valid system-wide.
