# Agit-Prop

Agitation propaganda!

When Trump and Brexit delusion syndrome was at its all time high - 'reaction' channels were a dime a dozen, whether from the left or right.

Sure some of them, had pithy remarks and memorable reactions, but the main kicker we all got from watching their videos was them getting 'mad'

When Kanye West asked Nick Fuentes about homosexuality, Nick responded, you don't attack gay mariage you promote straight marriage

The worst thing you can do is get angry

Is there a time and place for anger? Sure! It's called righteous indignation

But when you're angry you slip-up and get stupid(er)

Remember the meme 'triggered' and 'why you mad bro'?
