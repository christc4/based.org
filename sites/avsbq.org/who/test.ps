(I'm interested in simple computational solutions to real world problems. Simpler solutions are usually - but not always - less resource intensive, easier to teach, extensible and work well with other simple solutions. I hope to work in an environment where said problems are present and where I can within a team, learn, assist and solve.) R hbr jpar

(Server master (OpenBSD, rcctl, httpd, werc) - I run a private webserver that hosts websites for friends and family. I wanted to do this in the most computationally simple way, to not only minimise resource consumption but make it simple for other users to manually edit source files. Regarding the technical aspect, running OpenBSD has made me much more security-conscious than I previously was, as it is a security-oriented OS. In addition, 'werc' the anti-web framework has taught me how to completely avoid using javascript in numerous ways, such as auto generated sitemaps, user logins, comment sections, etc. This is due  to werc interfacting with Plan9 core utilities, RC and Awk scripts in the backend. Although, some javascript is needed, for when I don't want another page to be loaded, such as searchbars with suggestions.) R jpar

(Server master (Debian Linux, SystemD, nginx) - For one year I taught myself how to maintain a webserver. I chose my configuration of tools based on what was industry standard at the time.

This was a worthwhile investment as I now have tho knowledge to troubleshoot the commonmost issues facing webservers, as I tackled the same issues several times when setting everything up manually. Moreover, I spent a significant amount of time understanding why certain web practices such as '.shtml' and server side injections had been replaced in favour of scripting and static site generation.)

(Independent laptop repairman. I performed dozens of repairs on aging ThinkPads and installed lighweight base-versions of operating systems such as GNU/Linux and NetBSD.

I chose to learn how to repair older models so I could give said machines a second-home as opposed to ending up in a landfill where harmful chemicals could leach from their components.
