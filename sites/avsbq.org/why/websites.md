# Why I do websites

Last update: 2024/07/22

Imagine you have an interest you speak glowingly about - maybe you have many interests. Golden nuggets floating round your brain - real gold doesn't tarnish of course
, but your memories deteriorate. Eventually, you lose interest in said topic, your profound expertise gone down the drain.

# What if no-one visits avsbq.org?

Visitors always welcome - plenty of refreshments! - but the age of great web exploration is long over - these sites are for my future children.

# Why not use...

Medium, SubStack, flickr, pinterest, imgur etc?

Because then you are not a WebMaster but a WebSlave

Those sites push skittles and are very likely to ban me!
