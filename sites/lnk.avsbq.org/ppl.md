# People that have influenced me massively

> *NOTE*: I was baptised into the Eastern Orthodox Church â˜¦. Having said that, I haven't listed people opposed to my faith for the goal of scandalising anyone. If enough evidence builds up against characters listed here I may move them to the [miscellaneous](https://lnk.avsbq.org/misc) section where their name will be buried amongst a thousand others ;) You are free to make what you will of the people listed below. They have influenced my 19 year old self greatly
